## Getting Started

Install with your package manager of choice:

```
npm install --save-dev storybook-mirage
```

or

```
yarn add --dev storybook-mirage
```

Register the addon:

```js
// .storybook/main.js

module.exports = {
  stories: [],
  addons: [
    // Other Storybook addons
    "storybook-mirage", //ðŸ‘ˆ the addon registered here
  ],
};
```

Setup the decorator:

```js
// .storybook/preview.js

import { withServer } from "storybook-mirage";
import { makeServer } from "../path/to/server";

// optionally pass the server creator function to the decorator
export const decorators = [withServer(makeServer)];
```

Configure the decorator using the `mirage` [parameter](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/parameters):

```jsx
// Button.stories.js | Button.stories.ts

import Button from './Button';

export default {
  title: 'Button',
  component: Button,
  parameters: {
    mirage: {
      // automatically log requests to browser console https://miragejs.com/api/classes/server/#logging
      logging: true,
      // customize when a request responds https://miragejs.com/docs/main-concepts/route-handlers/#timing
      timing: 1000,
      // override route handlers for the story https://miragejs.com/docs/main-concepts/route-handlers/
      handlers: {
        get: {
          '/api/user': 404, // status code
          '/api/items': [204, {}, { items: [] }], // arguments for Response https://miragejs.com/api/classes/response/
        },
        post: {
          'api/task': { task: {} } // body for Response
        }
      },
      // data to seed Mirage ORM https://miragejs.com/docs/main-concepts/fixtures/
      fixtures: null,
      // pass in a custom Mirage server instance to override the global setting
      instance: null,
      // created seeded data from Factories defined within your makeServer function,
      // with the key names corresponding to Factory names.
      factorySeeds: {
        // create 2 addresses with the same traits.
        address: [{ traits: ['withRecipient', 'withCompleteAddress'], count: 2 }],
        // create a single cart item with no specific traits
        cart: [{}],
        // create 2 users that contain override values
        user: [
          {
            traits: [
              'withSomeTrait',
              'withOtherTrait',
              // override certain values
              {
                name: 'R2D2',
                gender: 'Male',
              },
            ],
          },
          {
            traits: [
              'withSomeTrait',
              'withOtherTrait',
              {
                name: 'BB8',
                gender: 'Male',
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
    },
    }
  },
};
```

### Development scripts

- `npm run start` runs babel in watch mode and starts Storybook
- `npm run build` build and package addon code

The addon code lives in `src`.

- `src/Panel.js` (displays server requests and handler stats)
- `src/withServer.js` (decorator to consume and configure MirageJS server)

Which, along with the addon itself, are registered in `src/preset/manager.js`.

Configure addon name in `src/constants.js`.

### Metadata

Storybook addons are listed in the [catalog](https://storybook.js.org/addons) and distributed via npm. The catalog is populated by querying npm's registry for Storybook-specific metadata in `package.json`. This project has been configured with sample data. Learn more about available options in the [Addon metadata docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/addons/addon-catalog#addon-metadata).

## Release Management

### Setup

This project is configured to use [auto](https://github.com/intuit/auto) for release management. It generates a changelog and pushes it to both GitHub and npm. Therefore, you need to configure access to both:

- [`NPM_TOKEN`](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens#creating-access-tokens) Create a token with both _Read and Publish_ permissions.
- [`GH_TOKEN`](https://github.com/settings/tokens) Create a token with the `repo` scope.

Then open your `package.json` and edit the following fields:

- `name`
- `author`
- `repository`

#### Local

To use `auto` locally create a `.env` file at the root of your project and add your tokens to it:

```bash
GH_TOKEN=<value you just got from GitHub>
NPM_TOKEN=<value you just got from npm>
```

Lastly, **create labels on GitHub**. Youâ€™ll use these labels in the future when making changes to the package.

```bash
npx auto create-labels
```

If you check on GitHub, youâ€™ll now see a set of labels that `auto` would like you to use. Use these to tag future pull requests.

#### GitHub Actions

This template comes with GitHub actions already set up to publish your addon anytime someone pushes to your repository.

Go to `Settings > Secrets`, click `New repository secret`, and add your `NPM_TOKEN`.

### Creating a releasing

To create a release locally you can run the following command, otherwise the GitHub action will make the release for you.

```sh
npm run release
```

That will:

- Build and package the addon code
- Bump the version
- Push a release to GitHub and npm
- Push a changelog to GitHub
